# Road Accident Tableau Dashboard
I have successfully developed a Road Accident Dashboard where I utilized various advanced features of Tableau. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in creating parameters to enhance interactivity, setting filters to analyze specific data subsets, and creating calculated fields to perform complex calculations. 

I also demonstrated my proficiency in designing different types of charts such as pie charts, maps, bar charts, and line charts, which helped visualize accident data effectively. Additionally, I incorporated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to provide a comprehensive understanding of the accident trends and patterns. 

This project allowed me to sharpen my Tableau skills and showcase my ability to deliver insightful visualizations for better data comprehension.

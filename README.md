# Road Accident Tableau Dashboard
I have successfully developed a Road Accident Dashboard where I utilized various advanced features of Tableau. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in creating parameters to enhance interactivity, setting filters to analyze specific data subsets, and creating calculated fields to perform complex calculations. 

I also demonstrated my proficiency in designing different types of charts such as pie charts, maps, bar charts, and line charts, which helped visualize accident data effectively. Additionally, I incorporated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to provide a comprehensive understanding of the accident trends and patterns. 

This project allowed me to sharpen my Tableau skills and showcase my ability to deliver insightful visualizations for better data comprehension. Included below is a link to the dashboard I constructed as part of this project!
